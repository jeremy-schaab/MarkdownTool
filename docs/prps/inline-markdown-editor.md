# Product Requirement Prompt: Inline Markdown Editor

## Objective/Problem Statement
Users need the ability to edit markdown files directly within the application without switching to external editors. The application should provide seamless editing capabilities with live preview functionality, allowing users to make quick modifications and see changes immediately.

## Success Metrics
- Users can successfully edit any loaded markdown file within the application
- Changes are reflected in real-time in the preview pane
- File saves are reliable with proper error handling
- Editor provides basic markdown syntax assistance
- Users can choose between inline editing and side-by-side editing modes
- No data loss occurs during editing sessions

## User Stories
- **As a content creator**, I want to edit markdown files without leaving the viewer application
- **As a documentation maintainer**, I want to make quick fixes to documentation and see changes immediately
- **As a technical writer**, I want syntax highlighting and markdown assistance while editing
- **As a reviewer**, I want to edit and preview content side-by-side to ensure formatting is correct
- **As a developer**, I want to edit README files and see how they'll appear on GitHub

   - Tabbed view (switch between edit/preview tabs)
5. **Save Functionality** - Save button with Ctrl+S keyboard shortcut
6. **Auto-save** - Optional auto-save every 30 seconds with user preference
7. **Unsaved Changes Warning** - Prompt user before navigating away with unsaved changes

### Editor Features
1. **Syntax Highlighting** - Markdown syntax coloring for headers, links, code blocks, etc.
2. **Line Numbers** - Optional line number display
3. **Basic Toolbar** - Common formatting buttons (bold, italic, headers, lists, links)
4. **Find/Replace** - Ctrl+F search functionality with replace option
5. **Undo/Redo** - Standard editing history with keyboard shortcuts
6. **Word Wrap** - Toggle for long line handling

### File Management
1. **Save Confirmation** - Visual feedback when file is saved successfully
2. **Error Handling** - User-friendly messages for file permission or disk space errors
3. **Backup Creation** - Optional backup file creation before overwriting
4. **File Status Indicator** - Visual indication of modified/saved state

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Editor loads within 2 seconds for files up to 1MB
- Live preview updates within 500ms of typing pause
- Syntax highlighting responsive for files up to 100KB
- Memory usage remains reasonable for large documents

### Usability
- Familiar keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+S, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+F, etc.)
- Responsive design works on different screen sizes
- Clear visual distinction between edit and view modes
- Intuitive toolbar with tooltips

### Reliability
- No data loss during editing sessions
- Graceful handling of file permission errors
- Recovery mechanism for unsaved changes after browser refresh
- Consistent behavior across different browsers

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Options

#### Option 1: Client-Side Editing (Recommended)
**Complexity: Medium (6-8 weeks)**

**Components:**
- **Editor Component** - Integration with CodeMirror 6 or Monaco Editor
- **File State Management** - Session state for edit mode and unsaved changes
- **Save Handler** - Browser-based file download for modified content
- **Layout Manager** - Dynamic UI switching between view modes

**Implementation:**
```python
# New functions in markdown_viewer.py
def toggle_edit_mode()
def save_file_content()
def handle_unsaved_changes()
def render_editor_interface()
```

**Pros:**
- No server-side complexity
- Works with uploaded files
- Immediate implementation possible
- No file system permissions needed

**Cons:**
- Save requires download/re-upload workflow
- Cannot directly modify files on disk
- Limited to browser capabilities

#### Option 2: Server-Side File System Integration
**Complexity: High (10-12 weeks)**

**Components:**
- **File API Endpoints** - REST API for file operations
- **Permission Management** - File system access controls
- **WebSocket Integration** - Real-time collaboration potential
- **Backend File Handler** - Direct file system manipulation

**Implementation:**
```python
# New modules required
file_api.py - FastAPI endpoints for file operations
file_manager.py - File system operations
websocket_handler.py - Real-time updates
```

**Pros:**
- Direct file system modification
- True save-in-place functionality
- Potential for collaboration features
- More traditional editing experience

**Cons:**
- Complex security considerations
- Requires significant architecture changes
- File permission complications
- Platform-specific implementations

### Recommended Implementation: Option 1 (Client-Side)

#### New Dependencies
- `streamlit-ace` or `streamlit-codemirror` - Code editor component
- Enhanced session state management

#### UI Components
1. **Editor Toggle Button** - Switch between view/edit modes
2. **Layout Selector** - Radio buttons for inline/side-by-side/tabbed views
3. **Editor Toolbar** - Formatting buttons and save controls
4. **Status Bar** - File status, cursor position, word count
5. **Save Dialog** - Download modified file functionality

#### Session State Management
```python
# New session state variables
st.session_state.edit_mode = False
st.session_state.editor_content = ""
st.session_state.has_unsaved_changes = False
st.session_state.editor_layout = "inline"  # inline, side-by-side, tabbed
```

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can click "Edit" button to enter editing mode for current file
2. Editor displays with syntax highlighting and line numbers
3. User can choose between inline, side-by-side, and tabbed layout options
4. Live preview updates within 500ms when user stops typing
5. Save button downloads modified file with original filename
6. Ctrl+S keyboard shortcut triggers save functionality
7. Warning appears when user tries to navigate with unsaved changes
8. Editor supports basic find/replace functionality (Ctrl+F)
9. Formatting toolbar provides quick access to common markdown syntax
10. Undo/redo functionality works properly (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y)
11. Editor handles large files (up to 1MB) without performance issues
12. Clear visual indicators show when file has been modified but not saved

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Editor (3-4 weeks)
- Inline editing mode with syntax highlighting
- Basic save functionality (download)
- Toggle between view/edit modes

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (2-3 weeks)  
- Side-by-side and tabbed layouts
- Live preview functionality
- Basic formatting toolbar

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (1-2 weeks)
- Find/replace functionality
- Auto-save option
- Unsaved changes warnings
- Performance optimizations

## Complexity Estimation
