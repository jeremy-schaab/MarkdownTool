# Document Linking Test

This file tests whether document links work between markdown files.

## Links to Other Files

Here are links to other markdown files in this folder:

- [View the README file](README.md)
- [Check out the API Test](api_test.md)
- [Read the User Guide](guide.md) 
- [See Project Notes](subfolder/notes.md)

## Relative Links

These use relative paths:

- [./README.md](./README.md)
- [./api_test.md](./api_test.md)

## Absolute Links

These use full paths:

- [README.md](test_files/README.md) (might not work)

## Web Links

- [External link to GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

## Internal Page Links

- [Jump to Links Section](#links-to-other-files)
- [Go to Web Links](#web-links)

This tests whether the markdown viewer can handle different types of links correctly.
