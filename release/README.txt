## üß™ Testing & Demo

### Live Demo
You can test the application with sample files:

1. **Clone the repository** and follow installation steps above
2. **Use the `test_files/` directory** included in the repository:
   ```
   test_files/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Basic markdown with links
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api_test.md        # API documentation example
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ guide.md           # User guide with complex formatting
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ links_test.md      # Internal link navigation test
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ subfolder/
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notes.md       # Nested file for link testing
   ```

3. **Set folder path** to the `test_files` directory
4. **Try different features**:
   - Select files to view and edit
   - Test internal link navigation
   - Generate AI summaries (requires Azure OpenAI setup)
   - Try different layout modes

### Testing AI Features

2. **Select a test file** (e.g., `guide.md` for comprehensive content)
3. **Generate summaries** with different templates
4. **Check `test_files/ai-summary/`** folder for saved summaries

### Performance Testing

- **Path Validation**: Internal link navigation validates file paths and extensions
- **Safe Rendering**: HTML content is safely rendered with Streamlit's built-in protections
- **Secure Credentials**: Azure OpenAI credentials stored in `.env` file (not committed to git)
- **API Rate Limiting**: Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff for API calls

## üé® Customization

The application uses GitHub-style CSS for markdown rendering. The styling includes:

- Syntax highlighted code blocks
- Responsive tables
- Clean typography
- Mobile-friendly design

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port Already in Use**
```
Port 8501 is already in use
```
Solution: Use a different port or kill the existing process:
```bash
python -m streamlit run markdown_viewer.py --server.port 8502
```

**Module Not Found**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'streamlit'
```
Solution: Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**File Permission Errors**
```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied
```
Solution: Ensure the application has read/write permissions for the target directory.

**AI Service Not Configured**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è AI service not configured. Please check your Azure OpenAI credentials in .env file.
```
Solution: Create `.env` file with proper Azure OpenAI credentials:
```env
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-5-mini
```

**Content Too Large**
```
Content is too large (XXX,XXX estimated tokens). Maximum allowed is XXX,XXX tokens.
```
Solution: Split large documents into smaller sections, or the document exceeds GPT-5 Mini's context window.

**API Rate Limits**
If you encounter rate limiting errors, the application will automatically retry with exponential backoff. For persistent issues, consider upgrading your Azure OpenAI tier.
